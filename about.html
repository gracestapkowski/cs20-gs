        <h2>Our Mission</h2> 
        <p>
            The mission of Stapkowski Nursery is to offer heathy and useful gardening products to the people of the Medford area. We want to
            create an appreciation for nature in an urban environment to hopefully spark a love for nature in our customers and encourage them
            to plant wherever they go. In addition, our store is very focused on reversing the impacts of climate change. Donations are always 
            welcome, and we plan to donate 10% of proceeds to combat it.
            <br/> <br/>
            We hope that you can find time to come into our store. We have seen gardening become a new amazing hoppy for so many customers. Let us
            make Boston beautiful and get some Vitamin D!
